Design of the official website for the Ukrainian rock band, Okean Elzy. I was able to capture the band's unique style and energy, creating a website that truly reflects their music and image. 

I used modern design elements and intuitive navigation to make the site easy to use for both fans and the band. Visitors can easily access information about upcoming concerts, purchase merchandise, and connect with the band on social media.
