The project involved creating a website to showcase Seat Leon and Seat Ibiza automobiles in an engaging and interactive manner. Visitors to the site were guided through a narrative that highlighted the cars' design, technical features, and financial services. The story-driven presentation allowed users to explore the key aspects of the vehicles, culminating in the opportunity to sign up for a test drive. This immersive approach provided a unique and memorable experience while effectively promoting the Seat Leon and Seat Ibiza models.
